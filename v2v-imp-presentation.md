That sounds like an awesome setup, Sky! You've got a well-structured multi-interface architecture combining infrastructure networking, V2V mesh, and distributed data forwarding. Here's how you could structure your presentation, with a breakdown of each component and a visual summary of how the layers interconnect:

---

## 🔧 Presentation Title:  
**"Multi-Interface V2V Mesh Network with NDN and BATMAN-ADV: Architecture & Components"**

---

## 🧱 Slide 1: **System Overview**

### Diagram (Center):
- Show Raspberry Pi with two Wi-Fi interfaces:  
  - **wlan1** → Internet Access (infrastructure mode)  
  - **wlan0** → Mesh Network (ad-hoc mode)  
- wlan0 → added to `bat0` (BATMAN-ADV virtual interface)  
- **bat0 IP subnet**: `172.27.0.x`
- Apps using **NFD** over `bat0`
- **ALFRED** and **batadv-vis** for mesh visualization

---

## 🔌 Slide 2: **Dual Wireless Interface Configuration**

- **wlan0**  
  - Mode: `adhoc`  
  - Attached to `bat0`  
  - Purpose: Mesh networking  
- **wlan1**  
  - Mode: `managed` (connected to infrastructure network)  
  - Purpose: Internet / SSH / Updates

### Notes:
- Separation of traffic types ensures reliability and flexibility.
- Optionally show `/etc/network/interfaces` or `nmcli` settings to reinforce how routing is isolated.

## 🕸️ Slide 3: **BATMAN-ADV (bat0) - Mesh Layer**

- **What it is**: Layer 2 mesh routing protocol
- **Why it's used**:
  - Self-healing
  - Dynamic topology awareness
- **How it works**:
  - `bat0` is a virtual interface managing routes over `wlan0`
  - Each node has an IP on `172.27.0.x`
- **Tools**:
  - `batctl o`, `batctl n` for routing info
  - `batadv-vis` creates a graphviz mesh map
  - `alfred` shares small JSON-style key-value data among nodes

---

## 🌐 Slide 4: **Named Data Networking (NFD)**

- **What is NFD**:
  - A forwarding daemon for **Named Data Networking**
- **Role in your system**:
  - Provides **content-centric** communication over mesh (no need for IPs)
  - Used for **file requests**, broadcasts, and subscriptions
- **Runs on**: Each node, listening on `bat0`
- **Advantages**:
  - Caching
  - No DNS or IP reliance
  - Multicast & efficient broadcast

---

## 🧭 Slide 5: **ALFRED & batadv-vis - Visualization Tools**

- **ALFRED (ALFRED Lightweight Framework)**:
  - Shares mesh node data (e.g., hostname, status, GPS coords) across the network
  - Shows live mesh status via key-value pairs

- **batadv-vis**:
  - Visualizes mesh topology
  - Outputs Graphviz `.dot` or JSON
  - Useful for debugging or real-time network state

### Visual:
- Include a screenshot of your `batadv-vis` mesh map

---

## 🔗 Slide 6: **Layered System Diagram**

### Suggested Diagram Structure:
```plaintext
Application Layer
 ├─ File Requests / Broadcast (NFD)
 └─ Mesh Visualization (ALFRED + batadv-vis)

Transport / Network Layer
 └─ NDN (NFD over bat0)

Data Link Layer
 └─ BATMAN-ADV (bat0 over wlan0)

Physical Layer
 ├─ wlan0 (mesh)
 └─ wlan1 (internet)
```

---

## 🚀 Slide 7: **Use Cases / Demonstration**

- Real-time file sync over mesh
- NDN packet tracing
- Visualizing the network topology live
- Failover: maintaining local V2V communication when WLAN is down

---

## 🧠 Slide 8: **Key Insights & Learnings**

- Pros of decoupling infrastructure and mesh
- NDN fits well with V2V as it doesn’t rely on stable IPs
- BATMAN-ADV makes dynamic topology handling simple
- Visualization boosts debugging and presentation quality

Would you like me to sketch out a slide deck for you in Markdown, or generate the visual diagrams for the layered architecture and mesh topology?
